## Streamlit: A Python framework for data apps

**SI Carpentries Brown Bag**
May 26, 2021

## Sharing an analysis: Notebooks

During Data Carpentry workshops, we showed how to work in either Jupyter notebooks (for Python) or R Markdown (for R)

## Sharing an analysis: Notebooks

As Paula showed at [March's Brown Bag](https://github.com/SmithsonianWorkshops/carpentries-brown-bag/tree/master/2021-03-24-rmarkdown), RMarkdown can combine code and explanation, and can be exported as PDF, Word, or HTML web page.

Jupyter can do the same (except for Word)

## In between: Binder

**Binder** does provide some interactivity in your Python or R code, but only if the user is familiar with Python or R -- or you do a great job with your explanations.

## In between: Binder

I gave a Brown Bag demo on Binder way back in the *Before Times*: https://github.com/MikeTrizna/binder_demo

## Interactive Data App

R users have had a good canonical solution for this problem since 2012: RShiny

## Interactive Data App

Many similar Python solutions have been developed since then:
* [Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/)
* [Panel](https://panel.holoviz.org/)
* [Voila](https://voila.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

## Streamlit

But [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) (released in October 2019) has emerged as the top Python solution for building interactive data apps.

## Streamlit

Pros: Comes with a great collection of pre-built widgets that lets you develop fast

Cons: You don't get the pixel-level customization that you might with other frameworks (or building your own web app)

## Streamlit Sharing

Streamlit [announced](https://blog.streamlit.io/introducing-streamlit-sharing/) a Beta program where they will host Streamlit apps for you, back in October 2020.

Need to request an invite, and then you are limited to 3 apps being shared at a time.
